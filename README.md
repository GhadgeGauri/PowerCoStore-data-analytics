Findings: 
● Approximately 10% of customers have churned 

● Consumption data is highly skewed and must be treated before modelling

● There are outliers present in the data and these must be treated before modelling 

● Price sensitivity has a low correlation with churn 

● Feature engineering will be vital, especially if we are to increase the predictive power of price sensitivity
